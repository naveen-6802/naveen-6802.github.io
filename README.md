# naveen-6802.github.io

naveen-6802.github.io, it is my main personal/portfolio website repository; tells about me, my skills, my experience and about projects I've built.
I made this website in just 2 days, it is built using basic HTML, CSS, JS and a lit bit jQuery. The theme and U.I.(User Interface) concept of this website is created by me and someone should not copy the same for their portfolio website, you should create your own, but feel free to see code of this website.

This link might take you to another domain/URL because I've pointed this GitHub domain to a custom domain.
